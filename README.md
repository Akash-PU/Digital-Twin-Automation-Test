# Digital-Twin-Automation-Test

The Digital Twin project aims to revolutionize infrastructure monitoring by creating a real-time, virtual replica of construction and civil engineering environments. This system enables autonomous, on-premise surveillance by integrating a network of edge devices—including high-resolution cameras, autonomous drones, and IoT sensors—with AI-powered analytics. The goal is to provide actionable insights, enhance safety compliance, and enable predictive maintenance by continuously capturing and analyzing site conditions across multiple dimensions.
